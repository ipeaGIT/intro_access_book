# GTFS data

The GTFS format is an open and collaborative specification that aims to describe the main components of a public transport network. Originally created in the mid-2000s by a partnership between Google and TriMet, the transport agency of Portland, Oregon, in the United States, the GTFS specification is now used by transport agencies in thousands of cities, spread across all continents of the globe [@mchugh2013pioneering]. Currently, the specification is divided in two distinct components:

- The GTFS Schedule, or GTFS Static, which contains the planned schedule of public transport trips, information about their fares and spatial information about their itineraries;
- The GTFS Realtime, which is used to inform, in real-time, vehicle location information, alerts for possible delays, itinerary changes and events that may interfere with the planned schedule.

Throughout this section, we will focus on **GTFS Schedule**, the most widely used GTFS format in accessibility analyses and by transport agencies. Click [here](https://gtfs.org/realtime/) for more information on GTFS Realtime.

Being an open and collaborative specification, the GTFS format attempts to enable several distinct uses that transport agencies and tool developers might find for it. However, agencies and applications may still depend on information that is not included in the official specification. Specification extensions, therefore, are created. Some of these [extensions](https://gtfs.org/extensions/) may eventually become part of the official specification if this is agreed upon by the GTFS community. In this section, we will focus on a subset of information available in the "vanilla" GTFS Schedule format, and will not, consequently, cover its extensions.

## GTFS structure

Files in the GTFS Schedule format (from this point onwards referred to as GTFS) are also known as feeds[^1]. A feed is nothing more than a compressed `.zip` file that contains a set of tables, saved in `.txt`, describing some aspects of the public transport network (stops/stations location, trip frequency, itineraries paths, etc). As in a relational database, tables in a feed have key columns that allow you to link information described in one table to the data described in another one. A sample of the GTFS scheme is presented in @fig-scheme, which shows some of the key tables that make up the specification and highlights how they relate to each other.

[^1]: In this book, we will use the terms feed, GTFS file and GTFS data as synonyms.

```

Overall, 22 tables make up the GTFS format[^2]. Some of them, however, don't need to be present to consider a feed valid and are, therefore, optional. The specification classifies the presence of a table into the following categories: required, optional and conditionally required (when the presence depends on the existence of a particular table, column or value). For simplicity, in this book we will consider only the first two categories and make sure to comment about the presence condition of a table whenever appropriate. Using our simplified convention, tables are classified as follows:

[^2]: As defined by the [official specification](https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/) in May 9th 2022.

- **Required**: `agency.txt`, `stops.txt`, `routes.txt`, `trips.txt`, `stop_times.txt`, `calendar.txt`.
- **Optional**: `calendar_dates.txt`, `fare_attributes.txt`, `fare_rules.txt`, `fare_products.txt`, `fare_leg_rules.txt`, `fare_transfer_rules.txt`, `areas.txt`, `stop_areas.txt`, `shapes.txt`, `frequencies.txt`, `transfers.txt`, `pathways.txt`, `levels.txt`, `translations.txt`, `feed_info.txt`, `attributions.txt`.

Throughout this section, we'll learn about the basic structure of a GTFS file and its tables. Thus, we will look only at the required tables and the optional tables most often used by producers and consumers of these files. For more information on the tables and columns not covered in this section, please check the [official specification](https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/).

In this demonstration, we use a subset of a feed describing the public transport network of São Paulo, Brazil, produced by SPTrans[^3] and downloaded in October 2019. The feed contains the six required tables plus two widely used optional tables, `shapes.txt` and `frequencies.txt`, enabling a good overview of the GTFS format.

```{r}
#| echo: false
path <- system.file("extdata/spo_gtfs.zip", package = "gtfstools")

gtfs <- gtfstools::read_gtfs(path)
gtfs <- gtfstools::remove_duplicates(gtfs)
```

### agency.txt

File used to list the transport operators/agencies running the system described by the GTFS file. Although the term agency is used instead of operators, it is up to the feed producer to choose which institutions will be listed in the table.

For example, multiple bus companies operate in a given location, but all schedule and fare planning is carried out by a single institution, either a transport agency or a specific public entity. This institution is also understood by the transit users as the system operator. In this case, we should list the institution responsible for planning the system in the table.

Now imagine a scenario in which a local public transport agency transfers the responsibility of operating a multimodal system to several companies (through concessions, for example). Each one of these companies is responsible for planning the schedules and fares of trips/routes they operate, provided that certain pre-established parameters are followed. In this case, we should list the operators in the table, not the public transportation agency.

@tbl-agency shows the `agency.txt` file of SPTrans' feed. We can see that the feed producers decided to list the company itself in the table, not the companies that operate the buses and the subway in the city.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-agency
#| tbl-cap: \`agency.txt` example
knitr::kable(gtfs$agency)
```

It's important to note that, although we are presenting `agency.txt` in table format, the file should be formatted as a `.csv` file. That is, the values of each cell must be separated by commas, and the contents of each table row must be listed in a different row. The table above, for example, is internally formatted as follows:

```{r}
#| echo: false
tmpfile <- tempfile("agency", fileext = ".txt")

data.table::fwrite(gtfs$agency, tmpfile)

content <- readLines(tmpfile)
cat(paste(content, collapse = "\n"), "\n")
```

For the sake of communicability and interpretability, we will always present the examples as tables. It is important to keep in mind, however, that these tables are internally structured as shown above.

### stops.txt

File used to describe the public transport stops in the system. The points listed in this file may reference simpler stops (such as bus stops), stations, platforms, station entrances and exits, etc. @tbl-stops shows the `stops.txt` of SPTrans' feed.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-stops
#| tbl-cap: \`stops.txt` example
knitr::kable(head(gtfs$stops[stop_desc != ""]))
```

The columns `stop_id` and `stop_name` identify each stop, but fulfill different roles. The purpose of `stop_id` is to identify relationships between this table and others that compose the specification (as we will later see in the `stop_times.txt` file, for example). `stop_name`, however, serves as an identifier that should be easily recognized by the passengers, thus usually assuming values of station names, points of interest names or addresses (as in the case of SPTrans' feed).

The `stop_desc` column, present in SPTrans' feed, is optional and allows feed producers to add a description of each stop and its surroundings. Finally, `stop_lat` and `stop_lon` associate each stop to a point in space with its latitude and longitude geographic coordinates.

Two of the optional columns not present in this `stops.txt` table are `location_type` and `parent_station`. `location_type` is used to indicate the type of location that each point refers to. When not explicitly set, all points are interpreted as public transport stops, but distinct values can be used to distinguish a stop (`location_type = 0`) from a station (`location_type = 1`) or a boarding area (`location_type = 2`), for example. The `parent_station` column, on the other hand, is used to describe hierarchical relationships between two points. When describing a boarding area, for example, the feed producer must list the stop/platform that this area refers to, and when describing a stop/platform the producer can optionally list the station that it belongs to.

### routes.txt

File used to describe the public transport routes operated in the system, including the transport modes used in each one of them. @tbl-routes shows the `routes.txt` of SPTrans' feed.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-routes
#| tbl-cap: \`routes.txt` example
knitr::kable(head(gtfs$routes[, -c("route_color", "route_text_color")]))
```

As in the case of `stops.txt`, the `routes.txt` table also includes different columns to distinguish between the identifier of each route (`route_id`) and their names. In this case, however, there are two distinct name columns: `route_short_name` and `route_long_name`. The first refers to the name of the route usually used by passengers on their daily routine, while the second tends to be a more descriptive name. SPTrans, for example, chose to highlight the start and endpoints of each route in this column. We can also note that the same values are repeated in both `route_id` and `route_short_name`, which is neither required nor forbidden - in this case, the feed producer decided that the route names could satisfactorily work as identifiers because they are reasonably short and unique.

The `agency_id` column works as the key that links the routes to the data described in `agency.txt`, listing an agency described in that file - in this case the agency with id `1` (SPTrans itself). This column is optional in the case of feeds containing a single agency, but is mandatory otherwise. Using a feed describing a multimodal system with a subway corridor and several bus lines as an example, a possible configuration of `routes.txt` could associate the subway routes to the subway operator and the bus routes to the agency/company responsible for planning the bus schedules.

The `route_type` column is used to describe the transport mode of each route. The above example lists rail lines, whose corresponding numeric value is `2`. The corresponding values of other transport modes are listed in the [specification](https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/#routestxt).

### trips.txt

File used to describe the trips that compose the system. The trip is the basic unit of movement in the GTFS format: each trip is associated with a public transport route (`route_id`), with a service that operates on certain days of the week (as we will later cover in `calendar.txt`) and with a spatial trajectory (as we will later cover in `shapes.txt`). @tbl-trips shows the `trips.txt` of SPTrans' feed.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-trips
#| tbl-cap: \`trips.txt` example

data.table::setcolorder(gtfs$trips, "trip_id")

knitr::kable(head(gtfs$trips))
```

The `trip_id` column identifies the trips described in the table, just as the `route_id` references a route described in `routes.txt`. The `service_id` column identifies the services that determine the days of the week that each trip runs on (weekdays, weekends, a mix of both, etc), described in detail in `calendar.txt`. The rightmost column in the example above is `shape_id`, which identifies the spatial trajectory of each trip, described in detail in `shapes.txt`.

The two remaining columns, `trip_headsign` and `direction_id`, are optional and should be used to describe the direction/destination of the trip. The first, `trip_headsign`, is used to report the text that appears on the vehicle headsign (in the case of buses, for example) or on information panels (such as on subway and rail stations) highlighting the destination of the trip. The `direction_id` column is often used in conjunction with `trip_headsign` to distinguish the direction of each trip, where `0` represents one direction and `1` the opposite (whether to use the value of `0` or `1` when describing a trip is up to the feed producer, as long as they represent opposite directions). In our example, the first two rows describe trips that refer to the same public transport route (`CPTM L07`), but in opposite directions: one runs towards Jundiaí, and the other towards Luz.

### calendar.txt

File used to describe the different types of service existing in the system. A service, in this context, denotes a set of days of the week in which trips may occur. Each service is also defined by an interval, with a start and an end date, within which it is valid. @tbl-calendar shows the `calendar.txt` of SPTrans' feed.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-calendar
#| tbl-cap: \`calendar.txt` example
gtfs$calendar[
  ,
  `:=`(
	start_date = as.integer(strftime(start_date, format = "%Y%m%d")),
	end_date = as.integer(strftime(end_date, format = "%Y%m%d"))
  )
]

knitr::kable(gtfs$calendar)
```

The column `service_id` identifies each service described in the table. As shown earlier, this identifier is also used in the `trips.txt`, where it is responsible for associating each trip to a particular service.

The `monday`, `tuesday`, `wednesday`, `thursday`, `friday`, `saturday` and `sunday` columns are used to set the days of the week in which each service operates. A value of `1` means that the service operates that day, while a value of `0` means that it does not operate. In the example above, the `USD` service operates every day of the week and the service `U__` operates only on business days.

Finally, the columns `start_date` and `end_date` delimit the service interval. Dates in GTFS files must always be formatted using the `YYYYMMDD` format: the first four numbers define the year, the subsequent two define the month and the last two, the day. The value `20220428`, for example, represents April 28th 2022.

### shapes.txt

File used to describe the spatial trajectory of each trip in the system. This file is optional, but feed producers are strongly recommended to include it in their GTFS files. @tbl-shapes shows the `shapes.txt` of SPTrans' feed.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-shapes
#| tbl-cap: \`shapes.txt` example
knitr::kable(head(gtfs$shapes[, -"shape_dist_traveled"]))
```

The column `shape_id` identifies each shape, and it is responsible for associating each trip to its spatial trajectory in `trips.txt`. Unlike all the other identifiers we have seen so far, however, `shape_id` is repeated in several table rows. This is because each `shape_id` is defined by a sequence of spatial points, whose geographic coordinates are described with the `shape_pt_lat` and `shape_pt_lon` columns. The `shape_pt_sequence` column lists the sequence in which the points connect to form the shape - values listed in this column should increase along the path.

### stop_times.txt

File used to describe the timetable of each trip, including the arrival and departure time at each stop. How this table should be formatted depends on whether the GTFS file contains a `frequencies.txt` table or not, a detail that we will cover later. For now, we will look at the `stop_times.txt` of SPTrans' feed, which also includes a `frequencies.txt`, in @tbl-stop_times.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-stop_times
#| tbl-cap: \`stop_times.txt` example
knitr::kable(head(gtfs$stop_times))
```

The trip whose timetable is being described is identified by `trip_id`. Similarly to what happens in `shapes.txt`, the same `trip_id` is found in many observations. This is because, just as a trajectory is composed of a sequence of spatial points, a timetable consists of a sequence of several departure/arrival times at various public transport stops.

The following columns, `arrival_time`, `departure_time` and `stop_id`, are responsible for describing the schedule of each trip, associating an arrival and a departure time at each visited stop. The time columns must be formatted using the `HH:MM:SS` format, with the first two numbers defining the hour, the subsequent two the minutes and the last two, the seconds. This format also accepts hour values greater than `24` - e.g. a trip whose last stop is visited at 1:00 a.m. the day after it departed from the first stop (let's say it has departed at 11:00 p.m.) must fill the arrival time as `25:00:00`, not `01:00:00`. The `stop_id` column associates the arrival and departure times with a stop described in the `stops.txt`, and the `stop_sequence` column lists the sequence in which the stops connect to form the trip schedule. The values of this last column must always increase along the trip.

It is worth highlighting here the difference between `shapes.txt` and `stop_times.txt`. Although both tables describe a trip spatially, they do it in different ways. `stop_times.txt` lists the sequence of stops and times that make up a schedule, but says nothing about the trajectory traveled between the stops. `shapes.txt`, on the other hand, describes the detailed trajectory of a trip, but does not specify where the public transport stops are located. Combining the information from the two tables, therefore, allows us to know both the schedule of each trip and the spatial trajectory between stops.

### frequencies.txt

Optional file used to describe the frequency of each trip within a certain time interval of a day. @tbl-frequencies shows the `frequency.txt` of SPTrans' feed.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-frequencies
#| tbl-cap: \`frequencies.txt` example
knitr::kable(head(gtfs$frequencies))
```

The trip whose frequency is being described is identified by the `trip_id` column. Again, the same identifier may appear in multiple observations. This is because the specification allows the same trip to have different frequencies throughout the day, such as at rush and off-rush hours, for example. Each row describes an interval that starts at the time in `start_time` and ends at the time in `end_time`.

Within the time interval specified by these two columns, the trip operates on regular headways specified in `headway_secs`. The headway is the time between trips performed by the same route. This time must be specified in seconds. In the example above, a headway of `720` between 4 and 5 am, therefore, means that the `CPTM L07-0` trip departs every 12 minutes within this interval.

**Using `frequencies.txt` and `stop_times.txt` together**

It is important to understand how the presence of a `frequencies.txt` table changes the specification of `stop_times.txt`. As we can see in the `stop_times.txt` example, the `CPTM L07-0` trip departs from the first stop at 04:00 am and arrives at the second at 04:08 am. The arrival and departure times at a given stop, however, cannot be specified more than once for each trip, even though the headway set in `frequencies.txt` defines that this trip departs every 12 minutes from 4 am to 5 am. If that's the case, how can we set the schedule of trips departing at 04:12 am, 04:24 am, 04:36 am, etc?

If the frequency of a trip is specified in `frequencies.txt`, the timetable of this trip defined in `stop_times.txt` should be understood as a reference that describes the time between stops. In other words, the times defined there should not be interpreted as is. For example, the timetable of trip `CPTM L07-0` establishes that the journey between the first and second stop takes 8 minutes to complete, which is the same travel time between the second and third stops as well. Thus, a trip departing from the first stop at 04:00 am arrives at the second at 04:08 am and at the third at 04:16 am. The next trip, which on the other hand departs from the first stop at 04:12 am, arrives at the second stop at 04:20 am, and the third at 04:28 am.

To describe the same trips in `stop_times.txt` without making a `frequencies.txt` table, could add a suffix that would identify each trip of route `CPTM L07` in direction `0` throughout the day. The trip with id `CPTM L07-0_1`, for example, would be the first trip 0 of the day heading towards direction `0` and it would depart from the first stop at 04:00 am and arrive at the second at 04:08 am. The `CPTM L07-0_2` trip, on the other hand, would be the second trip of the day and would depart from the first stop at 04:12 am and arrive at the second at 04:20 am. The rest of the trips would follow the same pattern. Each one of these trips would also need to be added to `trips.txt`, as well as to any other tables that would refer to the `trip_id`.

Another variable that changes how `frequencies.txt` affects the timetables in `stop_times.txt` is the optional column `exact_times`. When it assumes the value of `0` (or when it is missing from the feed, as in the case of the SPTrans' GTFS file) it indicates that the trip does not necessarily follow a fixed schedule over the time interval. Instead, operators try to maintain a predetermined headway during the interval. Using the same example of a trip whose headway is 12 minutes between 4:00 am and 5:00 am, this would mean that the first departure does not necessarily happen at 4:00 am, the second at 04:12 am, and so on. The first trip can, for example, leave at 4:02 am. The second, at 4:14 am or 4:13 am, etc. To define a schedule that is always followed with the exact same headway, obtaining the same result that would be obtained if we defined several similar trips departing at different times in `stop_times.txt` (as shown in the previous paragraph), we should use `exact_times` with value `1`.

## Finding GTFS data for Brazilian cities

GTFS data from cities all over the world can be downloaded with the [`{tidytransit}`](https://r-transit.github.io/tidytransit/) R package or on the [Transitland](https://www.transit.land/) website. In Brazil, several cities use GTFS data to plan and operate their transport systems. In many cases, however, this data is owned by private companies and operators and may not be public. GTFS data in Brazil, consequently, is rarely openly and publicly available, which goes against public interest data management good practices. @tbl-gtfs_brazil lists some of the few cities that make their GTFS feeds openly available to the public[^4].
