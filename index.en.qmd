# Presentation {.unnumbered}

Accessibility is the ease with which people can reach places and opportunities such as jobs, health and education services, cultural activities, green areas, etc. The accessibility conditions of  a city or neighborhood depend on the efficiency and connectivity of the transport network and on the proximity between people and activities. The topic of accessibility has been receiving increasing attention from transportation agencies, funding institutions, decision makers and researchers in the fields of urban and transport planning [@papa2015accessibility; @boisjoly2017how]. In the last few years, we have seen a growing number of scientific papers [@miller2018accessibility; @vanwee2021transport] and books [@levine2019mobility; @levinson2020transport] that deepens our understanding of urban accessibility issues. However, there are currently no books or articles that serve simultaneously as an introductory material to the subject and as a practical manual to teach computational methods to calculate and analyze accessibility data. The lack of this type of material helps explain, at least in part, why several transportation agencies and analysts still face challenges in incorporating accessibility issues and indicators into the day-to-day planning and research practice [@silva2017accessibility; @buttner2021accessibility].

The aim of this book is to equip its readers with the fundamental concepts, the data analysis skills and processing tools needed to perform urban accessibility analyses and assess the impact of transportation projects and policies. The book was written keeping in mind some of the problems faced by public managers, policy makers, students and researchers working on urban and transportation planning. Hence, the book has a practical character. All the material in the book is presented with reproducible examples using open data sets and the R programming language.

## Book organization

This book is divided into 5 sections:

```{r}
#| echo: false
tbl <- data.frame(
  Section = c(
	"[1: Introduction to urban accessibility](s1_intro.en.qmd)",
	"[2: Calculating accessibility](s2_calculo.en.qmd)",
	"[3: Public transport data](s3_dados_tp.en.qmd)",
	"[4: Impact assessment of transport projects](s4_avaliacao_impacto.en.qmd)",
	"[5: Access to Opportunities Project Data](s5_dados_aop.en.qmd)"
  ),
  Description = c(
	"The first section presents the concept of urban accessibility, clarifies the differences between accessibility and mobility, and presents the main indicators found in the literature to measure urban accessibility.",
	"The second section teaches how to calculate urban accessibility estimates in R using the `{r5r}` and `{accessibility}` packages and open data, and how to visualize results with maps and charts.",
	"The third section presents what is the GTFS specification of public transport data, and shows how to work and analyze GTFS data using the `{gtfstools}` package.",
	"The fourth section brings a case study to illustrate how the combined knowledge of previous chapters can be used to assess the impact of transportation policies on urban accessibility conditions.",
	"Finally, the fifth section shows how to download, analyze and visualize the data of the Access to Opportunities Project (AOP) to analyze the spatial and socioeconomic distribution of access to opportunities in Brazilian cities."

## Reproducing the book in your computer locally

To knit the book locally, you must first download its source-code . This can be done with [git](https://git-scm.com/) or manually by clicking on the following link: <https://github.com/ipeaGIT/intro_access_book/archive/refs/heads/main.zip>. In case you choose the second approach, you must also unzip  the contents of the ZIP file to a new folder.

This book was written and published with the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) publishing system. All of the code used in the preparation and publication of this book can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/intro_access_book).
:::

To render the book locally, you must have Quarto installed on your computer. Reproducing the code of chapters requires the use of the [`{renv}`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) R package, which manages the book's dependencies.

After the book dependencies are installed, you can run the book source code. Chapters are numerically ordered in files in `.qmd` format.  To run all chapters at once, use one of the following commands:

```r
quarto::quarto_preview()

quarto::quarto_render()
```
 
For more details on how to install the book dependencies and run their content locally, please see the installation instructions in the [book repository](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/intro_access_book).

## Running the book examples in the cloud with binder

A binder is a tool that allows one to run code in the cloud on a browser, such as Chrome and Firefox. The book code can be run using a server published by [mybinder](https://mybinder.org/). To run this book on Binder, click the icon below: after a few moments, an RStudio Cloud session will start running on your browser. This session includes all the files and data needed to run the book code.

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ipeaGIT/intro_access_book/HEAD?urlpath=rstudio)

Please note that mybinder sessions are limited to 2 GB of RAM. This restriction can prevent Chapter 6 from running properly. If you use binder, we suggest that you do not attempt to render the entire book with the Quarto, as shown above.
